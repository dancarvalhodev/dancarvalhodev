# Hi, I'm Daniel Carvalho 👍🏾🤘🏾

```php
$profession = 'Programmer';

function readProfession($profession) {
  echo $profession;
}

echo readProfession($profession);
```

- 🔨 I actually work with development for about 6 months and I learn uncontable things in daily of implement features and allow maintenance in the code in the future.

- ✨ Since my first contact with PHP I love the power and structure of language, including the community and big projects like [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com).
