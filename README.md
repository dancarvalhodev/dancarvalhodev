# Hi, I'm Daniel Carvalho 👍🏾🤘🏾

```php
$job = 'Programmer';

function readProfession($job) {
  echo $job;
}

echo readProfession($job);
```

- 🔨 I work with development for about 9 months and try improve myself daily.

- ✨ Since my first contact with PHP I love the power and structure of language, including the community and big projects like [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).
